## Quick resume
1. Read the frontmatter above: `current_focus` + `next_action` = the next piece of work.
2. `done:` = evidence of finished work; `blockers:` = what's stuck.
3. `handoff_kind: planned-next` → continue `next_action` right away.
   `handoff_kind: pause` → present `decisions_pending`, wait for a human decision first.

## Context (fits no field above)
- The Godot project has no `project.godot` yet — the first step is creating the project.
